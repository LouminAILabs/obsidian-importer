## Link Variations

### Markdown Style Links to Internal Files
[README File](README.md)
[Testing Framework](Projects/Testing%20Framework.md)

### Wikilinks with Paths
[[folder/subfolder/file]]
[[../parent-folder/file]]
[[./same-folder/file]]

### Case Sensitivity Tests
[[readme]] (should link to README if case-insensitive)
[[README]] (exact case)
[[ReAdMe]] (mixed case)

## Complex Link Scenarios

### Links in Lists
1. First item with [[link to README]]
2. Second item with [[Projects/Testing Framework|project link]]
3. Third item with external [link](https://obsidian.md)

### Links in Tables
| File | Link | Type |
|------|------|------|
| Main | [[README]] | Internal |
| Project | [[Projects/Testing Framework]] | Internal |
| External | [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) | External |

### Links in Quotes
> This quote contains a [[link to README]] and an external [link](https://obsidian.md).

### Links in Code Blocks
```
This code block mentions [[README]] but it shouldn't be a link.
Also mentions [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) but it shouldn't work either.
```

### Inline Code Links
This paragraph has `[[README]]` in inline code, which shouldn't be a link.

## Broken Link Scenarios

### Missing Extensions
[[README.txt]] (wrong extension)
[[Projects/Testing Framework.pdf]] (wrong extension)

### Invalid Characters
[[file with | pipe]]
[[file with * asterisk]]
[[file with ? question]]

### Circular References
This file links to [[Links and Embeds Test File]] (itself)

## Edge Cases

### Empty Links
[[]]
![[]]

### Very Long Link Names
[[This is a very long link name that might cause issues with rendering or parsing in some systems and should be tested thoroughly]]

### Links with Special Characters
[[File with Ã©mojis ðŸŽ¯]]
[[File with "quotes"]]
[[File with (parentheses)]]
[[File with [brackets]]]

### Multiple Links in Same Line
[[README]] and [[Projects/Testing Framework]] and [[Daily Notes/2023-01-01]]

### Nested Link Syntax
[[[README]]] (should this work?)
[[[[Projects/Testing Framework]]]] (what about this?)

## Tags as Links
#link-testing
#obsidian/links
#test-file
